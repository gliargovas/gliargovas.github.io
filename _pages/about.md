<h2 id="select-publications">About me</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;">

I am a **PhD student** at the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> of [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/index.html). My research focuses on **enhancing operating system scheduling** by integrating **machine learning techniques** to improve **performance** and **efficiency** in **dynamic environments**.

I hold a BSc. from the <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Department of Management Science & Technology</a> of **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a research associate at <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct software engineering research, advised by Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I am also a  research affiliate at the <a href='https://atlas-group.cs.brown.edu/'> Atlas Systems Group </a> at the Computer Science Department of <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Brown Univerisy</a>, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases">Linux Foundation</a>, advised by Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>. We developed <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf">`hs`</a>, an out-of-order shell script executor, that automatically executes scripts in parallel without any user involvement. We also developed <a src="https://github.com/binpash/try"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=binpash&message=try&color=blue&logo=github" alt="binpash - try"></a> <a href="https://github.com/binpash/try"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/binpash/try?style=social" alt="stars - try"></a>, a lightweight command-line sandbox tool which lets users inspect the results of a command before committing the result. I continue to actively work on `hs`, and `try`.

My **research interests** lie in the broader area of **computer systems**. I am deeply fascinated by the design and implementation of **self-optimizing systems** that can adapt to fluctuating performance requirements such as throughput, responsiveness, and scalability. Key to this is the blend of *system abstractions* which mitigate design-related overheads and *dynamic adaptation* made possible by system monitoring, scheduling and load-balancing methods. **Machine learning** excites me because it unlocks even greater potential for **system optimization**, enabling more intelligent, automated decisions that go beyond traditional methods.

<!-- My **past research** encompassed Software Engineering topics. Furthermore, for my thesis I constructed the scientific collaboration networks of [Greece](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_gr.png) and [Finland](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_fi.png).
