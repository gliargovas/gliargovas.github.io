I hold a Bachelor's Degree from the <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Department of Management Science and Technology</a> of **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a **research associate** at <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct research related to software engineering and programming languages, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I spent last year as a **research affiliate** at the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Computer Science Department </a> of **Brown University**, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases">Linux Foundation</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>. I continue to actively work on PaSh.

ðŸŽ“ I'm excitedly gearing up to **apply for PhD programs this fall**. Looking forward to diving deeper into research and making meaningful contributions.

My **research interests** encompass a wide range of topics. My interest on **computer systems** delves into areas like distributed systems, scheduling, concurrency, file systems, and kernel-level programming. I have also conducted research related to **empirical software engineering**, focusing in mining software repositories, software analytics, and CS education. Additionally, I have explored **programming languages** a bit, with emphasis on compilers and program analysis. Lately, an emerging curiosity of mine lies in **machine learning**, as a means of amplifying the outcomes of the fields above.

In my **free time**, I enjoy a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Long-distance running and cycling are close to my heart (feel free to follow me on <a style="display:inline-block;background-color:#FC5200;color:#fff;padding:4px 5px 4px 18px;vertical-align:middle;font-size:9px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:none;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:10px top;border-radius:3px;background-image:url('http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava-echelon.png')" href='https://www.strava.com/athletes/gliargko' target="_clean"><img src='http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava.png' alt='Strava' style='margin-left:2px;vertical-align:text-bottom' height=11 width=47 />

Additionally, I'm passionate about curating

Classic Rock, Indie, Alternative Rock, and Jazz are among my top genres, although I'm always open to exploring new musical horizons.
