<h2 id="select-publications">About me</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;">


<p>
I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at <strong>Columbia University</strong>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/index.html">Prof. Kostis Kaffes</a>. My research integrates <strong>LLM agents</strong> with <strong>traditional machine learning</strong> to improve <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong> in <strong>operating systems</strong>—with an emphasis on CPU schedulering, workload-aware adaptation, and safe, auditable control.
</p>

<p>
I’m part of Columbia’s <strong>Nebula</strong>  and <a href="https://daplab.cs.columbia.edu/">DAPLab</a> groups. I hold a BSc from the <a href="https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst">Department of Management Science &amp; Technology</a>, <strong>Athens University of Economics and Business</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was a research affiliate with the 
<a href="https://atlas-group.cs.brown.edu/">Atlas Systems Group</a> at <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, contributing to 
<a href="https://binpa.sh">PaSh</a> and 
<code>hs</code>, an out-of-order shell script executor. 
We also built <a src="https://github.com/binpash/try"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=binpash&message=try&color=blue&logo=github" alt="binpash - try"></a> <a href="https://github.com/binpash/try"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/binpash/try?style=social" alt="stars - try"></a>
, a lightweight shell-based sandbox.
</p>

<p>
Before Brown, I was a research associate at <a href="https://www.balab.aueb.gr">BALab</a> with 
Prof. <a href="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html">Diomidis Spinellis</a>, where I worked on empirical software engineering topics.
</p>

<p>
Today my work centers on <strong>agents for system optimization</strong> (e.g., LLM-driven parameter tuning and control) that blend robust systems abstractions with data-driven adaptation.
