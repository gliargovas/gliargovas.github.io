<h2 id="select-publications">About me</h2>
<hr style="border-width: 2px;">

I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> of [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/index.html). My research focuses on enhancing OS scheduling through the application of machine learning techniques.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree from the <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Department of Management Science and Technology</a> of **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a **research associate** at <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct research related to software engineering and programming languages, advised by Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I am also a  **research affiliate** at the <a href='https://atlas-group.cs.brown.edu/'> Atlas Systems Group </a> at the Computer Science Department of <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Brown Univerisy</a>, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases">Linux Foundation</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>. We developed <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf">`hs`</a>, an out-of-order shell script executor, that automatically executes scripts in parallel without any user involvement. We also developed <a href="https://github.com/binpash/try">try</a>, a lightweight command-line sandbox tool which lets users inspect the results of a command before committing the result. I continue to actively work on `hs`, and `try`.

My **research interests** lie in the broader area of **computer systems**. I am deeply fascinated by the design and implementation of **self-optimizing systems**, crafted to adapt to dynamic performance needs such as throughput, responsiveness, and scalability. Key to this is the blend of *system abstractions* which mitigate design-related overheads and *dynamic adaptation* made possible by system monitoring, scheduling and load-balancing methods.

<!-- My **past research** encompassed Software Engineering topics. Furthermore, for my thesis I constructed the scientific collaboration networks of [Greece](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_gr.png) and [Finland](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_fi.png).
