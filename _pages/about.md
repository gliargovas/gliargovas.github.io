I hold a Bachelor's Degree from the <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Department of Management Science and Technology</a> of **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a **research associate** at <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct research related to software engineering and programming languages, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I spent last year as a **research affiliate** at the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Computer Science Department </a> of **Brown University**, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases">Linux Foundation</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>. We developed <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf">`hs`</a>, an out-of-order shell script executor, that automatically executes scripts in parallel without any user involvement. I continue to actively work on PaSh.

My **research interests** lie in the broader area of **computer systems**. I am deeply fascinated by the design and implementation of **self-optimizing systems**, crafted to adapt to dynamic performance needs such as throughput, responsiveness, and scalability. Key to this is the blend of *system abstractions* which mitigate design-related overheads and *dynamic adaptation* made possible by innovative system monitoring, scheduling and load-balancing methods. Additionally, I am interested in leveraging **program analysis** techniques to drive software-level enhancements for these systems, embracing approaches like resource-based compilation and dynamic script optimization.

My **past research** encompassed Software Engineering topics. Furthermore, for my thesis I constructed the scientific collaboration networks of [Greece](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_gr.png) and [Finland](/assets/img/scientific_collaboration_fi.png).



In my **free time**, I enjoy a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Long-distance running and cycling are close to my heart (feel free to follow me on <a style="display:inline-block;background-color:#FC5200;color:#fff;padding:4px 5px 4px 18px;vertical-align:middle;font-size:9px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:none;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:10px top;border-radius:3px;background-image:url('http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava-echelon.png')" href='https://www.strava.com/athletes/gliargko' target="_clean"><img src='http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava.png' alt='Strava' style='margin-left:2px;vertical-align:text-bottom' height=11 width=47 />
</a> ), either solo or with the company of others. 
Additionally, I'm passionate about curating

Classic Rock, Indie, Alternative Rock, and Jazz are among my top genres, although I'm always open to exploring new musical horizons.
In earlier days, I used to play the piano and take music theory lessons.
