    In my free time, I enjoy a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Long-distance running and cycling are close to my heart (feel free to follow me on <a href='https://www.strava.com/athletes/gliargko' target="_clean"><a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/56433360" title="Strava"><i class="fab fa-strava "></i></a> ), either solo or with the company of others.
    Additionally, I'm passionate about curating <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/5tjsyyq952wsk4sm0sbog24yu?si=5e993390c0c64304"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pr-newsroom-wp/1/2018/11/Spotify_Logo_RGB_Green.png" style="display:inline-block;height:20px"></a> playlists. Classic Rock, Indie, Alternative Rock, and Jazz are among my top genres, although I'm always open to exploring new musical horizons.
    In earlier days, I used to play the piano and take music theory lessons.
